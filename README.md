# modularLAMP
A modular implementation of LAMP for compressed sensing. The original LAMP can be found <a href="https://github.com/mborgerding/onsager_deep_learning">here</a>.

Pytorch version of the Learned Approximate Message Passing(LAMP). Main contribution is the modular style of the unfolding.
The code is also numpy compatible, since the data generators are written in numpy and can be swapped out.
Running time/memory usage on the notebook are for the Google Colab 12GB Nvidia Tesla K80 GPU.

Feedback is very welcome.
